# Transitioning to Python + Machine Learning | Akanksha Rai

Hi! I'm Akanksha Rai — a backend software engineer with 5+ years of experience in building scalable web applications using PHP (Laravel), cloud services (AWS), and robust REST APIs.

Now, I'm channeling that experience into the world of **Python, Machine Learning, and Generative AI**.

## Why This Transition?

I’ve always loved problem-solving, automation, and optimizing systems — and that passion naturally drew me to ML/GenAI. After mastering backend systems, I’m now applying my software foundation to create intelligent applications that can learn, adapt, and respond.

## What I’m Learning

| Domain            | Tools & Concepts                             |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Python            | OOP, List/Dictionaries, Exception Handling, Flask |
| Machine Learning  | Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib      |
| GenAI             | LangChain, OpenAI API, RAG, Prompt Engineering |
| Dev & Cloud       | Git, Streamlit, Flask, AWS (S3, EC2), Docker |

## Projects

1. **A Streamlit GenAI Q\&A Bot Template**
   Path: `streamlit_app/app.py`
   This lets users upload a PDF and ask questions — ready to plug into any backend (like LangChain or Bedrock).

2. **A Titanic Survival Prediction Notebook**
   Path: `notebooks/intro_to_ml.ipynb`
   A beginner-friendly ML classification project using `scikit-learn`.
